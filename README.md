### Update 1 / AUG / 2018
- TODO: Add metadata to the image

## PENDING TASKS:
- Check if the communication comes from the same network,
	I could use XAMPP to serve the port, also a need to see how open port in my router.
- Use a command exif to select the desired image. [To confirm]
- Create a docket images to recreate all this.

## QUESTION:
- exif is a function that I need to do?, or use the already create exif to read the metadata of the images?
- I don't know what could be the difence vs little and big endian in the network transfer. How I can make a machine with diferent endianness ?
